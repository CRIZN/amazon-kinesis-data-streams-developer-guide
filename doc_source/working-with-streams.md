# Managing Kinesis Streams Using Java<a name="working-with-streams"></a>

These examples discuss the [Amazon Kinesis Streams API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/) and use the [AWS SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/) to create, delete, and work with an Kinesis stream\.

The Java example code in this chapter demonstrates how to perform basic Kinesis Streams API operations, and are divided up logically by operation type\. These examples do not represent production\-ready code, in that they do not check for all possible exceptions, or account for all possible security or performance considerations\. Also, you can call the [Kinesis Streams API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/) using other different programming languages\. For more information about all available AWS SDKs, see [Start Developing with Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/developers/getting-started/)\.
